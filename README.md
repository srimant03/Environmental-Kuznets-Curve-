A Case Study of Groundwater Quality, Economic Growth, and Environmental Kuznets Curve drawing insights from Indian Districts by monitoring nitrate levels. Carried out a regression analysis and observed a non-linear relationship between economic output (SDP) and pollution levels. Also studied the impact of income inequalities on groundwater quality levels by carrying out a year-wise and a region-wise analysis.
